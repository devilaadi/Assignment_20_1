1. Find out the state wise population and order by state

val population = sqlContext.sql("select state,sum(persons) as total_population from census group by state order by total_population desc").show 

2. Find out the Growth Rate of Each State Between 1991-2001

val growth_rate = sqlContext.sql("select state,avg(Growth_1991_2001) as total_growth from census group by state").show 

3. Find the literacy rate of each state

val literacy = sqlContext.sql("select state,avg(Persons_literacy_rate) as Avg_Persons_Literacy from census group by state").show 

4. Find out the States with More Female Population

val female_pop = sqlContext.sql("select state, sum(Males)-sum(Females) from census group by state").show 

5. Find out the Percentage of Population in Every State

val percenet_pop = sqlContext.sql("select state, (sum(persons) * 100.0) / SUM(sum(persons)) over() as percent_pop_by_state from census group by state").show
